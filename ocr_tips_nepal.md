# 📸 OCR Tips for FD Certificate Scanning

## Best Practices for High Accuracy

### 1. **Image Quality** (Most Important!)
- ✅ Use well-lit environment (natural daylight is best)
- ✅ No shadows on the certificate
- ✅ High resolution (at least 1920x1080)
- ✅ Clear, sharp focus (not blurry)
- ❌ Avoid low light/dark images
- ❌ No flash glare or reflections

### 2. **Camera Position**
- ✅ Hold phone/camera straight (not tilted)
- ✅ Parallel to certificate (90-degree angle)
- ✅ Fill the frame (certificate should be 80% of image)
- ✅ Include all borders and corners
- ❌ Don't crop important information
- ❌ Avoid extreme angles

### 3. **Certificate Condition**
- ✅ Flat, unwrinkled paper
- ✅ Clean (no stains or marks)
- ✅ Original or high-quality photocopy
- ❌ Avoid folded/crumpled certificates
- ❌ Faded or poor quality prints

### 4. **Background**
- ✅ Plain, contrasting background (dark desk for white paper)
- ✅ Solid color background
- ❌ Avoid busy/patterned backgrounds
- ❌ Don't place on reflective surfaces

### 5. **File Format**
- ✅ JPG or PNG (recommended)
- ✅ PDF (for digital certificates)
- ✅ File size under 5MB
- ✅ High DPI (300+ recommended)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Bank not detected"
**Solutions:**
- Ensure bank name is clearly visible
- Check if bank name is complete (not cut off)
- Manually select bank from dropdown
- Supported banks: 27+ Nepal banks (see list)

### Issue: "Amount not detected"
**Solutions:**
- Ensure amount is clearly printed
- Look for "Amount", "Principal", or "Deposit" label
- Check if NRs/Rs symbol is visible
- Common amounts: 25,000 to 10,00,000

### Issue: "Interest rate wrong"
**Solutions:**
- Verify rate is printed as "X.XX%"
- Look for "Interest Rate" or "Rate p.a."
- Nepal typical rates: 6.5% - 11%
- Check if rate includes "p.a." or "per annum"

### Issue: "Dates not detected"
**Solutions:**
- Ensure dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format
- Look for "Issue Date", "Start Date", "Maturity Date"
- Check if dates are clearly printed (not handwritten)
- Verify full 4-digit year (2024, not 24)

## Improving Low Confidence Results

If OCR confidence is below 75%:

1. **Retake Photo**
   - Better lighting
   - Clearer focus
   - Straight angle

2. **Use Edit Buttons**
   - Click pencil icon next to each field
   - Manually correct wrong values
   - Saves time vs. full manual entry

3. **Try Different Format**
   - If JPG fails, try PDF
   - Scan instead of photo
   - Use document scanner app

4. **Manual Entry**
   - For very poor quality certificates
   - Use "Edit All Fields" button
   - Fill form with OCR-suggested values
